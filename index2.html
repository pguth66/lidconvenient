One of the burning questions of our time is, "Should I put the seat down when
I'm done?" This page lets you run simulations to answer this question.
There are three strategies, explained below. When you click the button,
the simulator will run 1000 tests for each strategy and show you how many times someone
was inconvenienced - meaning how often someone had to either put up or
put down the seat before using the toilet.
</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The <a href="index.html">original version</a> of this simulator only treated it as an inconvenience if
someone had to move the seat prior to using it. But one could say that it's an
inconvenience if you have to move the seat <em>after</em> using the toilet as well.
This version of the simulator takes that into account, and gives very different results!
</p>
<p>
Since the mix of males and females involved can change the results, please enter
the number of males and females you'd like to use for the simulation below.
